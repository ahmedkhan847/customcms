In this post, I am going to share with you knowledge about data types and how they are used.</p>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\"aligncenter wp-image-15697 size-full\\" src=\\"http://www.cloudways.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/banner-mysql.jpg\\" alt=\\"mysql data types\\" width=\\"636\\" height=\\"334\\"></p>\\r\\n<p>Data types are the most important part in creating columns in tables.\\r\\n It define which type of value a column can contain and how long this \\r\\nvalue can be. Data type varies from column to column. Letâ€™s get started:</p>\\r\\n<h2>What is Data Type?</h2>\\r\\n<p>A data type is a particular kind of an item that you store in a \\r\\nvariable, whether it is returned from a function or you have defined it \\r\\nin your code. Data types are of different types, including numbers, \\r\\nstrings, dates and characters.</p>\\r\\n<p>MySQL also define different data types which you can get benefit from\\r\\n while creating columns of your table. Columns in a table can be of \\r\\ndifferent types, it can be a number, string, you can store your whole \\r\\nimage in bytes, or can define a column specifically for date and time. \\r\\nMySQL datatypes can be divided into different categories. I will define \\r\\nthree main, mostly used categories in this blog:</p>\\r\\n<ol><li>Number Type</li><li>String Type</li><li>JSON Type</li></ol>\\r\\n<h2>Number Type</h2>\\r\\n<p>MySQL uses all the numeric data types that you use mostly in your \\r\\nprogramming. Following are the list of commonly used numeric data types \\r\\nalong with their short description.</p>\\r\\n<ol><li>INT: It stores real numbers which can be signed or unsigned. Its range is -2147483648 to 2147483647.</li><li>FLOAT(M,D): It stores floating-point numbers which canâ€™t be \\r\\nunsigned. You can define the display length (M) and the number of \\r\\ndecimals (D). Default value for M and D is 10 and 2. Decimal precision \\r\\ncan go to 24 places</li><li>DOUBLE(M,D): It stores double floating-point numbers which canâ€™t be \\r\\nunsigned. You can define the display length (M) and the number of \\r\\ndecimals (D). Default value for M and D is 16 and 4. Decimal precision \\r\\ncan go to 53 places</li></ol>\\r\\n<h2>String Type</h2>\\r\\n<p>Most of your data will be stored in string formats. For this, MySQL \\r\\nhas provided the string data type. You can choose from them according to\\r\\n your needs. Commonly used string types are:</p>\\r\\n<ol><li>Char(M): It is a fixed length string whose range is between 1-255. Its default value is 1.</li><li>VARCHAR(M): It is variable length string whose range is between 1 â€“ \\r\\n255. Its value must be defined when creating a VARCHAR column.</li><li>TEXT: It stores large amount of data. You donâ€™t have to define a length for this when defining it. Its maximum length is 65535.</li><li>BLOB: These are Binary large objects, it stores the large amount of \\r\\nbinary data such images. You donâ€™t have to define a length for this when\\r\\n defining it. Its maximum length is 65535.</li></ol>\\r\\n<h2>JSON Type</h2>\\r\\n<p>In MySQL 5.7.7 they have introduced a <a href=\\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">new datatype JSON</a>.\\r\\n It used to store data which is in the form of JSON. Before this you can\\r\\n store your JSON format data in TEXT or VARCHAR fields but you have to \\r\\nwrite your own verification function before storing it on your database.\\r\\n However, after you have chooses this datatype for column it \\r\\nautomatically validates that the data which is being entered is in JSON \\r\\nformat or not. Its maximum length is 1073741824.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\\r\\n<p>Datatypes are the most necessary part of your database. It shows what\\r\\n the values of your columns really are. For example, if you are saving \\r\\nthe driving license of a person you can use VARCHAR and can set a limit \\r\\nof of 17 with hyphens, and a limit of 14 if you are not using hyphens. \\r\\nBy this way your database will automatically generate error if the limit\\r\\n crosses.</p>\\r\\n<p>Optimized MySQL Hosting&nbsp;with combined powers of Nginx, Apache web \\r\\nservers, PHP, and Varnish HTTP Accelrator along with Memcached and Redis\\r\\n cache, Cloudways ensures that load time of your website improves by \\r\\n100% on the Cloudways Platform.</p>\\r\\n<p>Sign up now with XMAS30 code enjoy the seamless <a href=\\"http://www.cloudways.com/en/mysql-hosting.php\\">Cloudways MySQL Hosting Platform</a> now.\\r\\n</p>', 2, '46.jpg', 'Internal-Blog-MySQL-Data-Typess/', '2016-01-14 17:34:00'),

Businesses are starting to understand the value in social media marketing. Instead of going to search engines, a growing number of users prefer to make queries on social networks such as Facebook when searching for products or services.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">But thereâ€™s more to using social media than setting up accounts on Twitter and Facebook and putting up posts and composing tweets. You need to be active and engaging, and offer information people are looking for. Without a definite plan, social media activities can be a waste of time â€“ or worse, a recipe for disaster.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Therefore, in order to make an impact, you must first formulate and commit to a long-term strategy that includes a content and social media plan, and an effective means for management and performance monitoring.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">The planning phase can be the most difficult part of your social media campaign and will be largely responsible for its success or failure. Here are five questions you need to answer to kick your social media campaign into gear.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">What Do You Want to Achieve with Social Media?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Social media networks are versatile and variant in nature, so itâ€™s important to have a clear vision of the goals you wish to achieve before starting your social media campaign. These goals need to be measurable, so you can track the progress of your campaign and shift your focus if things arenâ€™t going well.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">This will be crucial in determining which platforms you will sign up to and target, how frequently you will post on them, how many resources and staff you will allocate to the task, and the metrics and KPIs you will use to quantify the results of your postings.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">The most obvious goal of a social media strategy is to increase your company and brand presence and extend your reach. But there is much more you can achieve. Here are a few examples:</p><ul style=\\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.25em; margin-left: 25px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6; list-style: none; font-family: inherit; counter-reset: ol-counter 0;\\"><li style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; position: relative;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;\\">Increase traffic to your website:</span>&nbsp;By sharing links to your siteâ€™s content on your social media accounts, youâ€™re giving users new channels to refer to your website. If you have specific product and landing pages in mind, make sure youâ€™ve set up proper analytics tools and search streams to later track progress.</li><li style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; position: relative;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;\\">Improve company credibility:</span>&nbsp;Companies that have a strong social media presence are more likely to be considered by media outlets and reporters. You will need to interact with relevant accounts and hashtags and engage in conversations after you setup your accounts.</li><li style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; position: relative;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;\\">Offer extra customer service and create new lead generation channels:</span>&nbsp;Many customers prefer to make queries and ask questions through social networks instead of sending an email or picking up the phone. Social media can offer you an opportunity to reach new people.</li></ul><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Who Are You Going After?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Before starting your social journey, you need to define your target audience, because it will have a direct impact on the content and tone of your posts, which naturally have to be tailored to the people who will be viewing them.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">There are many factors that can help you identify your audience, including interests, age, gender, income, and area of residence. When using social media advertising services such as Facebook Ads, knowing the characteristics of your target audience will help make your campaign far more effective.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Which Platforms Should You Use?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">You have to decide in advance where youâ€™re going to focus your attention and choose the platforms youâ€™ll be using for your campaign.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">With the social media landscape more fragmented than ever before and dozens of multi-million-user platforms available for sign up, itâ€™s easy to get confused when choosing your target channel. Choosing the wrong platforms can turn your social media campaign into a disaster, while picking the right channel can go a long way toward achieving your business goals.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">To a large extent, youâ€™ll have to let the demographics and preferences of your target audience choose the social media networks youâ€™ll be using for your campaign.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Another way to find out which social networks you should spend time on is to look at which networks youâ€™ve already been finding success on. This can be easily achieved if youâ€™re already using an analytics tools such as Google Analytics to gather traffic data about your website. Dlvr.it blogger Debra Garber explains how to do so&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://blog.dlvrit.com/2015/09/create-an-editorial-calendar-to-save-time/\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">here</a>.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Pew Research Center has gathered&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/08/19/the-demographics-of-social-media-users/\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">demographics information</a>&nbsp;for top social media platforms which can also be helpful in choosing your starting point.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">It is best to start with a few platforms that are most relevant to your business, and then gradually expand your network as you perfect your presence on each one. Every social media platform has its own unique advantages and can help your business grow in one way or another.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">For instance, if youâ€™re running a restaurant or a cafÃ©, you might consider allocating some extra energy on setting up your Instagram account, where photos â€“ especially photos of food â€“ are shared more widely.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Meanwhile, a recruitment agency will find more success spearheading its campaign on LinkedIn, where finding professionals looking for a job is easier.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Also take note that the platform you choose will define the required activity and responsiveness. For example, Twitter users usually expect spontaneous and near-immediate responses when they mention your handle, and if you donâ€™t reply to their tweets, theyâ€™ll end up choosing a competitor. So if you donâ€™t have the resources to answer quickly, signing up on platforms like Twitter might have a negative impact on your business goals.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Before you get started with each of the platforms, make sure you understand its dynamics. Rebekah Radice has a&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://rebekahradice.com/kickstart-a-social-media-strategy/\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">post</a>&nbsp;which will help you get familiar with the major social media platforms and the types of material that should be posted on each.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">What Content Should You Post and How Often?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">The best content strategy is one that involves mixed content. There need to be posts that showcase your products, but others need to address the specific needs and interests of your target audience. If youâ€™re only posting bland messages about your latest offers and prices, people will likely tune out and avoid you in the future. Curate posts that are interesting, like news stories, how-to articles, videos and picture lists that are relevant to your industry and to your products and services.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">One guideline that can help you plan your content is&nbsp;<a href=\\"http://www.marketo.com/_assets/uploads/Your-Sample-Social-Editorial-Calendar.pdf\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">Marketoâ€™s 411 rule</a>, which means post four educational or entertaining post for every soft promotion (e.g. events) and hard promotion (e.g. demos, products, etc). Basically, it means gain the trust of your audience by providing value.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Also talk directly to your audience and encourage people to interact with your brand continuously.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">This is often the forgotten aspect of social media marketing. Many businesses post on their accounts a couple of times a week and leave it at that. You need to show your customers that you care about what each person has to say about your business.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">In fact much of what you post and how often you do it will depend on the activities that your customers perform. If they ask you a question, answer it (even if itâ€™s just a simple thank you), if they post a photo of your products, re-post it (or retweet it or share it). Making positive connections sharply increases the likelihood of a follower converting and making a purchase.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">These simple gestures go a long way to managing relationships with your followers and creating a stable base of loyal customers, if that is what you wish to attain through your campaign. Do not underestimate the strength of emotions in selling a product or service.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">Instead of diving headlong into posting updates on your social media accounts, consider first creating a high-level view of the content youâ€™re planning to put up on each platform. This will help you ensure you cover all the topics and areas involved in your business industry. It will also help you better plan user engagement on each network. You can use the following plan as a guide to scheduling your content posts.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\"><span style=\\"font-weight: 700; line-height: inherit;\\">Example: High level social plan (for an event decoration company)</span></p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\"><a href=\\"http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14544032351.png\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\"><img src=\\"http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/14544032351.png\\" alt=\\"High level social plan for an event decoration company\\" width=\\"975\\" height=\\"260\\" class=\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-123905\\" style=\\"border-style: none; border-width: initial; max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 30px auto;\\"></a></p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">What Should I Post Tomorrow, Next Week or Next Month?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.8; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\\">No campaign should start without a schedule. Lay out the broad outline of your campaign for at least four to six months ahead. Start by setting up milestones and deadlines for your campaignâ€™s iterations, and define the goals of each phase. Also be on the lookout for occasions, holidays, and events on your calendar and mark them.

It also offers flexibility: Once you get the wheels of your campaign rolling, youâ€™ll be able to compare your performance with your campaignâ€™s goals and deadlines, and make the correct adjustments and corrections for each phase. Whether a daily, weekly or monthly calendar will suit your needs is up to you.

The main idea behind Hocus-Pocus is to make a universal and lightweight stylesheet starter kit that focuses on the most common features. In this article, Iâ€™ll cover why I decided to build my own Sass framework and the approach Iâ€™ve taken when doing so.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Why Have I Started Working on a Sass Framework?</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">In short, I would say Iâ€™ve started working on a Sass framework because I wanted to save time when starting new web projects. Iâ€™ve noticed that even when I work on really custom designs, I always add the same set of tools, include the same standard packages, and implement a similar collection of basic CSS components.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">The second question that follows then is â€”&nbsp;<em style=\\"line-height: inherit;\\">Why you donâ€™t you use an existing, well-known and proven framework like Bootstrap?</em></p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">My response to this comes down to preferences and my approach to CSS. I think libraries like Bootstrap or Foundation are great and have greatly changed how people think about CSS. However, in most cases within my own project work, I just donâ€™t need all these features and UI components like progress bars or breadcrumbs. Instead, I prefer to have something more universal. I prefer something that I can use in any project, without needing to override framework CSS classes.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">Due to the reasons above, in Hocus-Pocus you can change the look of every single component with variables. You can even disable some features or define a range of helpers. The downside of this approach is that I canâ€™t provide a compiled CSS version of the framework as there is no reasonable way to use Hocus-Pocus without an ability to update variables.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Pre-requirements and principles</h2><h3 style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20.8px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Installation</h3><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">The framework is available and easy to install with two different package managers: Bower and npm. It requires Sass (minimum required version is 3.3.0) and&nbsp;<a href=\\"https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">Autoprefixer</a>&nbsp;to run. Autoprefixer is used to add necessary vendor prefixes to the final compiled CSS file. I donâ€™t worry too much about compatibility between various browsers nowadays as I personally find autoprefixing to be sufficient. Additionally, I use sass linter (<a href=\\"https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint\\" style=\\"color: rgb(54, 155, 200); line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word; padding: 5px 0px 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgba(54, 155, 200, 0.298039); transition: all 0.3s ease;\\">scss-lint</a>), but this is not required for running Hocus-Pocus and doing things the right way. Hocus-Pocus will work without it.</p><h3 style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20.8px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Naming Convention</h3><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">The next principle is an important one for every framework â€” the naming convention. I prefer regular, dash style class names without BEM. I wonâ€™t complain if you are a fan of BEM and prefer to use the BEM naming convention, if it works for you â€” go for it. From my perspective, BEM doesnâ€™t fix all of the responsibility problems in CSS. I also find that I approach my CSS using less class-level elements when I use BEM. Adding a new element to an existing block is just too easy.</p><h3 style=\\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 20.8px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Documentation</h3><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">Last but not least, I pay close attention to writing documentation and keeping the Hocus-Pocus changelog up to date. Documentation doesnâ€™t have to be perfect, especially at the beginning, but I always try to find time to improve it. This helps newcomers learn how the tool works and allows me to keep track of framework features.</p><h2 style=\\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(38, 38, 38); text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 34px; letter-spacing: -0.02em;\\">Framework Features</h2><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">The following framework features are the most characteristic to Hocus-Pocus in my opinion and give the best overview of what its focus really is.</p><p style=\\"margin-bottom: 32px; padding: 0px; direction: ltr; font-family: Roboto, \\\'Helvetica Neue\\\', Helvetica, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 28.8px; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\\">Most of the framework classes are inspired from existing projects that Iâ€™ve worked on in the past.
